This is my javascript bar web app project.
I am using this to learn javascript, and I think it'll be great for that purpose:
	It will start small with basic functionality
	It can expand into something HUGE with endless possibilities and complexity
The end goal for this is to have an online fully functional and designed environment that mimics the real life bar experience.

I am using Git to keep track of the changes I make to this project, and to hopefully collaborate as I build this app.

Feel free to break down, critique, and criticize my code and style, I am all about learning everything I can to make this great.
I'd also love to hear any thoughts on what I'm doing and what I hope to achieve.
